# Movies-ETL

## **Overview**
The support provided in this repository represents an exercise in extract, transform, load (ETL) of movie data between three interrelated files, wikipedia movie listings, kaggle movie listings and ratings.
The goal of the assignment was to import 'murky' data and clean the datasets so they could be merged together and loaded into a SQL database.
